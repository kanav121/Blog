    "text": "Are you tired of feeling stuck in your career? Do you dream of making a significant change but don’t know where to start? As a data scientist specializing in time series modeling and regression-based models using R, I felt exactly the same way. But I’m here to tell you that with the right mindset and a little bit of hard work, anything is possible.\nI made the decision to shift my career from the energy sector to either health or finance industries, with a goal of securing a job that would offer at least a 120% salary increase from my current position, ideally in the fintech space. And guess what? I not only achieved that goal but also landed my dream job!"
